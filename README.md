## Introduction

In today's world, energy efficiency and environmental consciousness are crucial. EcoAppMeter aims to empower users to understand the power consumption of their applications and encourage them to adopt more sustainable practices. With a user-friendly interface, anyone can quickly determine the power usage of their favorite applications and assess their impact on the environment.

## Features

- **Application Power Consumption Calculation**: Enter the details of your application, such as the name of the app, the number of CPUs, CPU power consumption, memory power consumption, the number of GPUs (if used), GPU power consumption, and the time the app is running.
- **Calculate Power Consumption**: After entering the application details, click the "Calculate" button to compute the total power consumption.
- **Display Results**: React will render the name of the application along with the power consumption and the time the app consumes the power in hours.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up EcoAppMeter on your local machine.

### Prerequisites
